# Lab-1 ECSE3038  
## Hello GitWorld

### Description: This is a simple introduction to git through a lab that asks to implement 3 functions.  

### The three functions behave as follows:

#### **hello()**
1. Prints "ECSE3038 - Engineering IoT Systems" when called

#### **validatePassword()**
1. Accepts a password
2. Checks if password is > 7 characters and is alphanumeric
3. Checks if password has 2 or more digits

#### **sumUptoN()**
1. Accepts a number
2. Checks if number < than 1 and returns -1
3. If number is > 1, returns sum of all numbers from 1 to the selected number.


> Why do we tell actors to *“break a leg?”*  
>> Because every play has a **cast**
